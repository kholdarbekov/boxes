Dear candidate!

Thank you for applying on our position and for your resume.

Before we can move forward, please, proceed with a test task. We don't have deadlines, but it would be great if you make it ASAP. 

After you share the results, based on your results, we will set up an interview. 


The TASK:

Create basic database microservice to connect to MongoDB database.
Use provided GRPC proto file as specification for API.
Use any libraries that you want for GRPC I would recommend python-betterproto (prerelase version) and grpclib.
Microservice itself should load all required parameters from environmental variables.
Database should be designed mainly for fast selections rather than inserts.
Code should follow standard style guides and should contain type hints. If you need, we can provide a blank MongoDB database for testing purposes.
You can find a blank MongoDB database for testing purposes here: mongodb://root:7TJj3gEi5y5@13.74.35.181:27018
